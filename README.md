# Carnival
Friend project to: [Jungle - Study - Java] written in C. More supplies towards GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows.

\[6th March, 2023\]  
Due to project code responsibility allocation controversial issue, previous "Carnival" or "Carnival_MinGW" and "Carnival_GNU" is found ambiguous to be continue on development.  
Thus, we created a new repository for dividing job responsibility, for Carnival, for all.

We will not change our original promise in file README from previous storage.  
Here they are:

>\[31st Jan, 2023\]  
>Carnival is currently in development, this project will roughly go on the stage with polish in about 6 more months(in the worst scenario).
>
>For development, Carnival is now devided into two parts for multi-platform performance.  
>They are:
>  - Carnival_MinGW
>  - Carnival_GNU  
>
>The MinGW one is obviously majorly for Windows;  
>The GNU one is yet again, apparently mostly for GNU/Linux;
>
>BTW, if you'd like to have C/CXX compilers on Android, there's my project [Attraction (Early development stage)](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Attraction).
>If there were any questions, please contact via e-mail at "williampascal_official@outlook.com". I might not be reply in time, thank you.

# Welcome to Carnival MinGW!ðŸ¥³

Project: __[Carnival - Study - C]__  
Compiler: x86_64-w64-mingw32  
IDE: [Embarcadero](https://www.embarcadero.com/) [Dev-Cpp](https://www.embarcadero.com/free-tools/dev-cpp)

<u>***Precaution: ISO-C99 standard is majorly used in development.***</u>

<!-- As you may have known, the original project I wrote was [Jungle - Study - Java]. It was aimed to train myself to see if or not I could generalise what I have learnt in the past of three years of studying Java. -->

<!-- Like I said, __\[Jungle - Study - Java\]__ was a tool used in life to somehow improve my accessibilities to all tools I might use during processes of studying. Like a tool set, you see. -->

<!-- Here, I'm going to try to have another purpose-aimed project which I declaim here, used to fully improve my abilities to C and, as well my general mindset towards all accessories of all programming languages. I shall be here, no more to say. --><!--

\[31st Jan, 2023\]  
Carnival is currently in development, this project will roughly go on the stage with polish in about 6 more months(in the worst scenario).

For development, Carnival is now devided into two parts for multi-platform performance.  
They are:
  - Carnival_MinGW
  - Carnival_GNU  

The MinGW one is obviously majorly for Windows;  
The GNU one is yet again, apparently mostly for GNU/Linux;

BTW, if you'd like to have C/CXX compilers on Android, there's my project [Attraction (Early development stage)](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Attraction).
