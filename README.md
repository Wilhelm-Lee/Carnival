# Welcome to Carnival!ðŸ¥³

Project: __[Carnival - Study - C]__  
Compiler: x86_64-w64-mingw32  
IDE: [Embarcadero](https://www.embarcadero.com/) [Dev-Cpp](https://www.embarcadero.com/free-tools/dev-cpp)

<u>***Precaution: ISO-C99 standard is majorly used in development.***</u>

<!-- As you may have known, the original project I wrote was [Jungle - Study - Java]. It was aimed to train myself to see if or not I could generalise what I have learnt in the past of three years of studying Java. -->

<!-- Like I said, __\[Jungle - Study - Java\]__ was a tool used in life to somehow improve my accessibilities to all tools I might use during processes of studying. Like a tool set, you see. -->

<!-- Here, I'm going to try to have another purpose-aimed project which I declaim here, used to fully improve my abilities to C and, as well my general mindset towards all accessories of all programming languages. I shall be here, no more to say. -->

Carnival is currently in development, this project will roughly go on the stage with polish in about 6 more months(in the worst scenario).

For development, Carnival is now devided into two parts for multi-platform performance.  
They are:
  - Carnival_MinGW
  - Carnival_GNU  

The MinGW one is obviously majorly for Windows;  
The GNU one is yet again, apparently mostly for GNU/Linux;

BTW, if you'd like to have C/CXX compilers on Android, there's my project [Attraction (Early development stage)](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Attraction).

If there were any questions, please contact via e-mail at "williampascal_official@outlook.com". I might not be reply in time, thank you.
