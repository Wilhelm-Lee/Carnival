## Brief
A friend project to: [__\[Jungle - Study - Java\]__](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/STUDY) written in C. More supplies towards [__GNU__](https://www.gnu.org/)/[__Linux__](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) and __MicrosoftÂ® Windowsâ„¢__.

## Features

## Support for TTY
Carnival's output is simply __ASCII__[^1] (TUI). However, colouring is not strictly required, as an compatibility for non-colourable terminals.  
For TTY, our first priority, we do provide basic rendering on most terminals.  

## Compilers
In code, we tried to make Carnival more compatible with different compilers.  
In current stage, it's mainly supported by:
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)

Please note, unlike what we did preivously, Carnival is now assembled with those compilers' support.  
That means, you could have used your compilers to build this project and execute the result regaurdless about what your compilers are as long as they are in support. :)[^1.1]

## C Standard
In Carnival, we use __C99__[^2] standard.

## Build

## DevLog
__\[6th Mar, 2023\]__  
Due to project code responsibility allocation controversial issue, previous "Carnival" or "Carnival_MinGW" and "Carnival_GNU" are found ambiguous to be continued on development.  
Thus, we created a new repository for dividing job responsibility, for Carnival, for all.

We will not change our original promise in file README from previous storage.  
Here they are:

>\[31st Jan, 2023\]  
>Carnival is currently in development, this project will roughly go on the stage with polish in about 6 more months(in the worst scenario).
>
>For development, Carnival is now divided into two parts for multi-platform performance.  
>They are:
>  - Carnival_MinGW
>  - Carnival_GNU  
>
>The MinGW one is obviously majorly for Windows;  
>The GNU one is yet again, apparently mostly for GNU/Linux;
>
>BTW, if you'd like to have C/CXX compilers on Android, there's my project [Attraction (Early development stage)](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Attraction).
>If there were any questions, please contact via e-mail at "williampascal_official@outlook.com". I might not be reply in time, thank you.
