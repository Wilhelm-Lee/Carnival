## Brief
Friend project to: [\[Jungle - Study - Java\]](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/STUDY) written in C. More supplies towards [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) and Microsoft® Windows™.

## Support for TTY
Carnival's output is simply ASCII (TUI). However, colouring is not strictly required, as an compatibility for non-colourable terminals.  
For TTY, our first priority, we do provide basic rendering on most terminals.  

## Compilers
In code, we tried to make more compatibilities for different compilers, mainly for [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) & [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/).

Of course, there would be other architecture and compilers await to be added. But for now, it shall be as is.

## DevLog
\[6th Mar, 2023\]  
Due to project code responsibility allocation controversial issue, previous "Carnival" or "Carnival_MinGW" and "Carnival_GNU" are found ambiguous to be continued on development.  
Thus, we created a new repository for dividing job responsibility, for Carnival, for all.

We will not change our original promise in file README from previous storage.  
Here they are:

>\[31st Jan, 2023\]  
>Carnival is currently in development, this project will roughly go on the stage with polish in about 6 more months(in the worst scenario).
>
>For development, Carnival is now devided into two parts for multi-platform performance.  
>They are:
>  - Carnival_MinGW
>  - Carnival_GNU  
>
>The MinGW one is obviously majorly for Windows;  
>The GNU one is yet again, apparently mostly for GNU/Linux;
>
>BTW, if you'd like to have C/CXX compilers on Android, there's my project [Attraction (Early development stage)](https://github.com/WilliamPascal/Attraction).
>If there were any questions, please contact via e-mail at "williampascal_official@outlook.com". I might not be reply in time, thank you.
